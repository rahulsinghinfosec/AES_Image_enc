# AES_Image_enc

<p>This is an <b>image encryption</b> script.</p>
<p>I made this after I read a research paper on image encrytion using <b>AES</b></p>
<p>I have tried to implement the algorithm as per my current understanding, and if you wish to read it. Here's the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Agilandeeswari-Loganathan/publication/315365473_A_novel_image_encryption_algorithm_using_AES_and_visual_cryptography/links/5d80d373458515fca16e45d7/A-novel-image-encryption-algorithm-using-AES-and-visual-cryptography.pdf">link</a></p>
